This repository is the source code for the paper "UVCE-IIITT@DravidianLangTech-EACL2021: Tamil Troll Meme Classification: You need to Pay more Attention"

This is a deep learning model for multimodal analysis of Tamil memes given the images and its captions. The main idea was to gain more attention and not use any CNN or RNN.

Steps to run:

1) Run the makeAndSplit.py to split the data
2) Run the train.py to train the model
3) Run the test.py for inference
